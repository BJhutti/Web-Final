            <img src="Images/zss.webp" id="img1" alt="A picture of zss">
            <p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a platform fighter video game that is a massive Esport in the current 
                world. It has many characters and stages, 
                but this site will focus on the fighter
                Zero Suit Samus, her moves, how she is played,
                and other information. </p>
        
            <h2>Character Background</h2>
            <p>Samus broke ground early in the gaming world
                when she debuted in the 1986 game Metroid. 
                Although Samus wears the Power Suit throughout
                most of the Metroid series, she traditionally removes it at the end of most games, often as a result of satisfying certain conditions such as completing the game quickly or with a high percentage 
                of the game's items collected or even both. This is known as 
                Zero Suit Samus.</p>
            <h2>In Smash Games</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Super Smash Bros Brawl</dt>
                <dd>ZSS first appeared in Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. She was available through 
                    a tranformation of regular Samus. In this game, she used her armour pieces as a way to damage
                    the enemy from a distance. </dd>
                <dt>Super Smash Bros WiiU</dt>
                <dd>In this game, Zero Suit was given her own character slot on the select screen. She became a grappler 
                    character, using her long grabs to get big combos. She was a top tier character.

            <h2>Attributes</h2>
            <div id="atts">
                <h3>Speed</h3>
                <blockquote>ZSS's mobility is the best in the game. With a high jump and fast dash, she can move around the whole stage.</blockquote>
                <h3>Weight</h3>
                <blockquote>ZSS is very light, in the top 10 lightess characters. However, this is mititgated by her not being hit often due to her speed.</blockquote>
                <h3>Power</h3>
                <blockquote>Her moves are not the strongest in terms of damage, but combo into each other vey well.</blockquote>
            </div>
            <h2>Gameplan</h2>
            <p>ZSS is a very hit-and-run based character. With her strong speed and long moves, she is able to hit-and-run
                away and get small hits where they matter. These small hits give her big combo stings, allowing her
                to rack up percents quickly. She also can aim to whiff punish her opponents moves by staying just out of range. At kill percents, ZSS will look for her kill moves such as Up-b and Up-smash.
            </p>
